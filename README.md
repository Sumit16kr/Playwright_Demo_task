# Info
The framework is created with Playwright as a testing tool and typescript as a language

# Why playwright ?
I chose Playwright for UI automation due to its advanced capabilities and modern approach, including its use of WebSocket communication. This allows for real-time, bidirectional communication between the testing script and the browser, resulting in faster, more reliable tests. WebSocket usage enhances debugging, as it enables immediate feedback and interaction with the browser. Playwrightâ€™s support for multiple browsers and its ability to handle complex UI interactions, combined with these efficient communication methods, make it an excellent choice for thorough and efficient UI automation.
